<h1>How to use Toonloop</h1>
This document explains how to use Toonloop 1.x for GNU/Linux. 

Toonloop 1.x is supported by either Ubuntu GNU/Linux or Debian GNU/Linux operating system. You should get one up and running prior to do the next steps. 

<h2>Step 1 : Download</h2>
There are two packages you need to install. First install Pygame 1.9, next install Toonloop. 

You can download <a href="http://bitbucket.org/aalex/toonloop1/downloads/python-pygame_1.9.1release-2_i386.deb">Pygame 1.9 here</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/aalex/toonloop1/downloads/toonloop_1.0.8_all.deb">Toonloop there</a>.

<h2>Step 2 : Installation</h2>

Once you have successfully downloaded the packages, simply double-click the files and the GDebi package installer should ask you if you want to install it. Make sure you install Pygame before Toonloop.

<h2>Step 3 : Launching Toonloop</h2>

Once the software is installed, there should be a Toonloop icon in the Applications : Sound & Video menu. Choose that application from that menu. It will launch Toonloop. 

Toonloop uses the first video camera it finds. Toonloop currently only supports cameras whose driver supports the Video4Linux2 API. To use Toonloop, there should a file called "/dev/video0" on your computer. If you see an image from a video camera input in the Toonloop window, it means it worked. Otherwise, Toonloop should just crash silently. If it is the case, you should start Toonloop from the terminal in order to be able to read some informations about the reasons it crashed. See the section "Starting Toonloop from the Terminal" for more informations about this. 


Once Toonloop is running, you should see a black window with the live video input image on the left. Congratulations ! In the left window, you can see what is seen by the live camera. In the right window, it is the result of the stop motion loop.

<h2>Step 4 : Make sure you are using the right camera</h2>

If you have more than one video camera and want to use a different one than the one Toonloop has chosen, you need to specify Toonloop options at startup. See the "Custom Options" section. 

Toonloop supports only Video4Linux2 video cameras. That includes USB Video Class cameras, as well as some analog video capture cards.

<h2>Add frames to a clip</h2>

Press the space bar to add a frame. You can also press on the left button of the mouse. 

<h2>Delete frames</h2>

Press on the Backspace key. You can also use the right mouse button.

<h2>Save to a movie file</h2>

Press on the S key to save the current clip to you hard drive. It is saved in the Documents/toonloop/new_project folder in your home directory.

<h2>Keyboard Controls Summary</h2>

Toonloop is an interactive software. While it runs, or can control it using keyboard keys. Here is a list of keystrokes to control Toonloop.

<pre>
[Space bar] = Adds an image to the current clip.
[Backspace] = Removes an image from the current clip.
r = Resets the current clip. This erases all the images in it !
p = Pauses the looping.
o = Toggles onion skin on / off.
i = Prints informations and statistics.
h = Prints an help message.
s = Saves the current clip as JPEG and movie file.
a = Enable the intervalometer auto grab.
k = Increase the intervalometer interval.
j = Decrease the intervalometer interval.
x = Saves the current configuration options to ~/.toonloop.json
. = Changes the graphicals style.
[tab] = Changes the playback direction of the current clip.
[0, 9]  = Selects a clip from the current project identified by a number.
[Esc] = Quits the program.
[Up arrow] = Increases the frame rate. (faster)
[Down arrow] = Decreases the frame rate. (slower)
[Left arrow] = Moves the write head to the left. (towards the beginning)
[Right arrow] = Moves the write head to the right. (towards the end)
[Return] = Moves the write head to the last frame. (at the end)
</pre>

<h2>Starting Toonloop from the terminal</h2>

On Ubuntu, the Terminal is an application located in the Application - Accessories menu. You can launch Toonloop from there, and specify arguments and options to customize how the software behaves. Try entering the following command, and press "enter".

<pre>
toonloop -v
</pre>

You can launch Toonloop with a whole bunch of options. Options are set
using the -o flag :

<pre>
toonloop -o toonloop_home ~/Public/toonloop -o project_name hello -o intervalometer_enabled False -o bgimage_glob_enabled True -o image_flip_horizontal True -o chromakey_on True -o chromakey_on True -o chromakey_r 0.2 -o chromakey_g 0.9 -o chromakey_b 0.0 -o chromakey_thresh 0.5 -o chromakey_slope 0.2 -o fudi_enabled True -w 320 -v
</pre>

<h2>Custom Options</h2>

The --option command line option allows one to specify specific keyword identified by a keyword. Their type can be integer, float, string of boolean. Boolean options can be given using integer of python-style boolean string. A true value can be specified as True, or 1. A false value is set as 0 or False.

Once Toonloop has been started by some keyword config options, those options can be saved to the ~/.toonloop.json configuration file. Next time Toonloop is launched, those configuration options will be read from that file. If Toonloop behaves strangely, you should try deleting that file. 

Here is the list of options with their default values:

  -o autosave_enabled True
  -o autosave_on False
