About this file
---------------

Here we list taks to be done. Once they are done, they should go in the RELEASE notes. 

Once the tag is done for the version number in the RELEASE notes, they are moved to the NEWS file, (most recent first) and we update the version number in the RELEASE notes and the configure.ac file, and we remove all the task that are done from the RELEASE notes. 


Things to do in priority
------------------------

Right now, here is the list of tasks to prioritize: 

 * Auto-record video sometimes doesn't work
 * Make sure the keystroke instructions are in only one place.
 * playback: allow to play all clips from 0 to 9
 * video: support different sizes (currently only 640x480)
 * saving: Create a done_saving signal and make the moviesaver call it with the movie file name and the clip id
 * Pixbuf saving: 
   * #1: Write the pixbuf to a memory stream and then splice_async() it to the file. 
   * #2: fork() then call gdk_pixbuf_save() in the child process. Use a pipe to handle the return value in the parent. Probably that the glib mainloop should shut itself down with pthread_atfork(). Look for screenshot_save_start() in gnome-utils/gnome-screenshot/screenshot-save.c
 * edit: Onion skin
 * edit: Allow to capture video at the camera's FPS. (not the clip's playhead only)
 * saving: Save projects to XML
 * saving: Load projects from XML

OSC Messages to implement
-------------------------

Receiving:
  *  /toon/playhead/goto <i>
  *  /toon/playhead/iterate
  *  /toon/clip/select <i>
  *  /toon/clip/save

Sending:
  *  /toon/framerate <i>
  *  /toon/writehead <i>
  *  /toon/playhead <i>
  *  /toon/clip/index <i>
  *  /sampler/play/start <i>
  *  /sampler/play/stop <i>
  *  /sampler/record/start <i>
  *  /sampler/record/stop <i>


Road map
--------

To be done for Version 2.0
--------------------------

Once those tasks are done, the features to be implemented in branch 2.x are:

 * video: do not crash if the v4l2 device is busy
 * API: figure out the best OSC API, as well as the keyboard GUI controls
 * Press 'i' to print current loop frame number, number of frames in loop and global framerate.
 * Press 'h' to show some help 
 * Press 'p' to pause playback.
 * Press 'o' to toggle the onion skinning on/off.
 * packaging: fix make check. Re-add previous tests, including headers from src
 * themes: Support layouts
 * themes: Create a single-image layout, combining the two image with the overlay blending mode.
 * gui: Display information in either a HUD, or a mx GUI in Clutter
 * packaging: Improve STK packaging
 * edit: add an option to delete JPEG images when deleted from a clip
 * edit: support playing back a single clip or all of them
 * Press 'n' to select the next effect available.


To be done for version 2.2 : Towards professional features
----------------------------------------------------------

 * saving: Support saving in AVI
 * saving: create a subdir for each clip in images and movies dirs
 * Load/save a whole project (many clips)
 * themes: portrait theme (rotation to the right)
 * edit: mirror
 * video: Use the default GStreamer-properties camera when none is given
 * video: Use an inputswitcher element. The video capture element in the Gstreamer pipeline must be dynamic. It means that the user could choose v4l2src, or an other source, depending on the hardware available. Ideally, some detection could be done. See ekiga.
 * display square to represent frames in timeline
 * GUI dialog which allows the user to choose the name of the saved clip.
 * Save all clips (all 10 from 0 to 9) with modifier (shift?)
 * playing two clips at a time
 * two onion skin layers
 * Saving improvements. Add a level of indexation. 
 * Background images can be an other clip.
 * Load images to a clip.
 * Load a movie file to a clip.
 * Save background image when saving a clip.
 * Basic sequences of clips.
 * Add PNG and TGA saving image formats.
 * gui: Clutter Mx GUI (buttons, sliders, menu, etc.) 
 * effects: Port the shaders from 1.x (See doc/effects.txt)
 * effects: one effect per clip
 * effects: Min/max values for effects attributes.
 * optimization: Read a few bytes from an image to trigger the kernel's read-ahead. (?)
 * midi: MIDI learn for controls


Other Ideas for Future Directions
---------------------------------

 * Multi layers (multi clips at a time)
 * Advanced GUI for controlling clips and sequences
 * Multi-layers sequences with blending mode
 * Rippling effect (strobing) effect (like in _Pas de deux_)
   * variable delay between each former frame
   * variable number of former frames displayed
 * Variable frame duration in a shot (freeze frame) and speed tweening.
 * Color improvements (brightness, contrast, saturation)
 * masks (matte)
 * invert effect
 * diff effect
 * contour effect
 * threshold effect
 * translation *paths* and multiple sequences at a time
 * plug with community vision, or opencv.
 * Use a "Pixel Buffer Object" to move data into the texture  instead. You'll need the "ARB_pixel_buffer_object" extension.  This pages has a good description of what they are and how to use them:  http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_pbo.html
 * Joystick input.
 * Remote control input.
 * Update the Smooth and Tween classes to C++. Merge them with this project. http://code.google.com/p/libinteract/source/browse/#svn/trunk/trunk/general
 * Support for video mapping. (needs a matte + separating the rectangle in a grid of rectangles, with coordinates that are interpolated linearily)


Done 
----

See also the doc/DONE document.

 * edit: Intervalometer
 * Press the comma (",") to move the write head to the left. (towards the beginning)
 * Press the dot (".") to move the write head to the right. (towards the end)
 * Press slash to move the write head to the last frame. (at the end)
